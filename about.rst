About P.P.M.E.
==============

The PPME tool has been developped to serve as a country-level Procurement Performance system for Benchmarking, Monitoring and Evaluation (BM & E) using parameters based on international best practices in the area of Procurement and Quality Management.

This tool enables the country to conduct procurement performance assessment measurements of all Procurement Entities. It has been designed as a self assessment tool to be applied at all levels of the Procurement System!

The PPME Tool is expected to be a world class Procurement Assessment System which will be adopted by all Development Partners.
